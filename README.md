## Team environment setup instructions
For now we are going to assume we can use python3 and flask.

### Step 1. Install Anaconda 3 for python install
Download link: https://www.anaconda.com/download/
- For now install version 3.6, we might have to come back and install 2.7 later

### Step 2. Install PyCharm IDE
We are going to be using pycharm for our IDE.  If you haven't already, register with IntelliJ so that you can get access 
to their IDEs for free.

Link: https://www.jetbrains.com/student/

Once you register they should send you the licenses pretty much right away.

Download and install "Pycharm".

### Step 3. Repository
In order for us to use a private repository everyone needs to register for the GitHub Student Pack

Link: https://education.github.com/pack

Bunch of cool stuff but we will just be using the private repositories pretty much.

Once you have gotten the pack let me know so that I can send you an invite to be a collaborator on the project.

### Step 4. Add project to PyCharm
After I have invited you to the project, you can sign in to PyCharm and go to "add from version control" or something
like that and select our repository. 

It will be called tech_kings3

### Step 5. CODE
We got lots of shit to do
Once you get the repository and stuff, please, please, PLEASE make sure that you create your own branch before starting.
Do not change things on the Master branch because that could mess up other peoples work.  I'll be making a "test" 
branch that we can check changes we make on before pulling them into the master branch.
